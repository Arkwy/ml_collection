 # Machine Learning Algorithms Collection

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms in **Python** and **C++**. Each language has its own dedicated folder, with a separate README file providing more details about the implementations and usage.

ðŸš¨ Note: This repository is intended for personal learning and experimentation. As a result, tools, libraries, and dependencies may vary across implementations.


## Implemented Algorithms
### Python
âœ… **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**
   - **Dependencies**: PyTorch, OpenCV (for visualization)

ðŸš§ **More algorithms coming soon!**

### C++
ðŸ”„ **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) â€“ In Progress**
   - **Dependencies**: HIP 

ðŸš§ **More algorithms planned!**

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arkwy/ml_collection.git
   cd ml_collection
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired language folder (`python/` or `cpp/`).
3. Refer to the respective `README.md` for setup and usage instructions.
