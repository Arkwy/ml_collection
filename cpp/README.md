# Machine Learning Algorithms - C++

This folder contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms in **C++**. Each algorithm is structured within its own subfolder, with `[algo]/main.cpp` serving as the entry for each of them.

## Dependencies
To build and run the implementations, you need to have a working C++ compiler (GCC or Clang recommended) and the required dependencies.

### Installation
    
For Nix users, you can enter a development shell with the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
nix develop
```
    
For other users refer to the [HIP documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/index.html) (you'll probably have to additionnally install [rocrand](https://github.com/ROCm/rocRAND)).

## Building and Running the Project
A `Makefile` is provided to compile and run the program. To build and execute go to the the folder of an aglorithm and run:

```bash
make
```

If the build succeeds, the program will automatically run.
